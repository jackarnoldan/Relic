# Relics Manifesto

Money is broken. Blockchains are bloated, miners are greedy, servers are choke points, and fees are a tax on freedom. Relics is the antidote: 20 million `.rlx` files, each a sovereign unit of value, forged with cryptographic steel. No blockchain, no middlemen, no bullshit—just pure, uncopyable digital money that works offline, on a toaster, in a bunker.

Relics isn’t just a system; it’s a rebellion. We’re building money that’s:
- **Scarce**: 20 million Relics, hard-capped by SHA-256 mint keys, no exceptions.
- **Ownable**: You hold the `.rlx` file and private key, you own it. No one else.
- **Unstoppable**: Trade via USB, QR code, or paper. No internet, no censorship.
- **Lean**: 256 KB files, verified locally, faster than Solana, tougher than Bitcoin.
- **Ours**: Open-source, community-built, for the people, by the people.

The world doesn’t need another blockchain—it needs Relics. We’re launching the first mint key on July 17, 2025, 17:06:00 +01:00, and we need *you* to make it happen. C++ coders, security samurais, UI visionaries—join us to forge a new era of value. This isn’t about code; it’s about rewriting the rules of money. Be part of the legend.

**Join the fight. Build Relics. Change the world.**
